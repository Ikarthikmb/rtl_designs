# Half Adder 
A simple 2 bit Binary adder

Adding two 2-bit binary numbers

```verilog

```

The addition of two numbers results in sum and carry. Consider A and B be 2-bit binary numbers that results in 3 bit output where the third bit constitutes to carry bit.

Equation:

```verilog
Sum = a XOR b
Carry = a and b
```
