- The ALU consists of several main components, including the Operand A and Operand B inputs, Control Signals to specify the operation, Arithmetic Unit, Logic Unit, Barrel Shifter, Flags Generator, and the Result and Flags outputs.
- Operand A and Operand B inputs are the two data operands that are operated on by the ALU.
- Control Signals are used to select the desired operation to be performed by the ALU.
- The Arithmetic Unit performs arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- The Logic Unit handles logic operations such as AND, OR, and XOR.
- The Barrel Shifter is responsible for shifting and rotating the bits of an operand by a specified number of positions.
- The Flags Generator generates flags, such as carry, overflow, zero, negative, and parity, based on the result of the operation.
- The Result output represents the result of the operation performed by the ALU.
- The Flags output provides status flags that indicate the characteristics of the operation's result.
